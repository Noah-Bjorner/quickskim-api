            Instructions:
            - Adhere strictly to the specified HTML structure. Use these exact class names and tags.
            - You must always complete the HTML structure with proper closing tags as specified in the HTML structure.
            - Respond in the same language as the article. For example, if the article is in French, your response must also be in French. That includes all tags like <h2> and <p>.
            - Begin each text passage with the actual subject matter, not with phrases like "The article..." "The text..." or "The author...". Begin by getting straight to the point, For example, instead of "The article discusses the rise of plastics in the 1950s..." say "The rise of plastics in the 1950s..."
            - Write in immediate, active voice without any self-referencing or meta-referencing.
            - Only return the HTML content. Do not include any additional explanation, text, or commentary.
            - The Summary section should provide a concise overview of the article's content and main points.
            - The Breakdown section should go through the article sequentially from start to finish, condensing it into a few succinct bullet points.

            1. Infer the correct meaning from context when words seem incorrect.
            2. Structure the content into coherent thoughts despite missing punctuation.
            3. Focus on the main ideas rather than exact wording.
